# terminal-commands

This is a collection of terminal commands/scripts I made because I was bored and/or needed them (it's faster)

Each folder contains a separate readme with additional information. Most scripts can be "installed" my moving them into the /usr/local/bin directory (for swift projects, you first need to compile it; Tested on macOS, might not work on other platforms)

All projects use the same License ([MIT](LICENSE))
